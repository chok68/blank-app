My name is Emily Johnson, and I reside at 456 Elm Avenue, Denver, CO, 80203. The veteran I am referencing is William Johnson, whose full name appears exactly as written on his official service records. William served honorably in the United States Navy, with periods of service spanning from June 10, 1990, to June 9, 2000. He entered active duty on June 10, 1990, and was honorably discharged on June 9, 2000.

William qualifies for veterans' preference due to a non-compensable service-connected disability recognized by the Department of Veterans Affairs. As his spouse, I am applying for this preference on his behalf. I am currently married to him, and I have never remarried. William is not deceased, and while he did not die on active duty, he sustained a service-related disability that impacts his ability to work. 

I understand that documentation, such as service records and confirmation of his disability status, is required to validate this claim. I have reviewed the conditions outlined in 5 U.S.C. 2108, 2108a, and 5 CFR part 211 and believe my responses meet the criteria for consideration under these guidelines.
