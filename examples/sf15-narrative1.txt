My name is John Doe, and I live at 123 Main Street, Springfield, IL, 62704. I am providing this information in support of a request related to veteran's preference. The veteran in question is James Doe, as his name appears on his service records. His periods of service were from January 15, 2005, to January 14, 2015. He served in the United States Army, entering active duty on January 15, 2005, and separating from active duty on January 14, 2015.

James Doe qualifies for veterans' preference based on a compensable service-connected disability determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs. As his spouse, I am claiming this preference because his service-related disability has rendered him unable to qualify for a federal government job. I am currently married to him and have never remarried.

James did not die on active duty, nor is he deceased; however, he is totally and permanently disabled due to his service-connected injuries. I understand that supporting documentation, as outlined by the Department of Veterans Affairs, is required to confirm eligibility for this preference. My responses align with the guidelines set forth under 5 U.S.C. 2108, 2108a, and 5 CFR part 211.
